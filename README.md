Go to https://facebook-messenger-clone-46e9a.web.app/ to look at my Facebook messenger clone. The authentication and storing of the messages was done with firebase.I used using React for the backend,Firebase for storing the messages and authenticating the user, and Material-UI for all of the icons.
